    "question": "What foundational shift in AI necessitated the evolution of prompt engineering into the formal discipline of Context Engineering?",
    "expected_answer": "The necessity arose because Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from simple instruction-following systems into the **core reasoning engines of complex applications** [1]. This shift demanded more sophisticated methods for designing and managing their informational payloads, leading to the formal discipline of Context Engineering [1, 2]. (Source: 1 Introduction, 3 Why Context Engineering)",
    "claude_answer": "Based on the document, the foundational shift occurred when Large Language Models (LLMs) evolved from simple instruction-following systems into core reasoning engines of complex applications. This transformation meant that LLMs were no longer just responding to isolated prompts, but became central components that needed to process and reason over large amounts of contextual information. This shift demanded more sophisticated methods for designing and managing the informational payloads sent to these models, which led to the development of Context Engineering as a formal discipline."

    "question": "How does the target optimization complexity, denoted as $F^*$, differ fundamentally between traditional prompt engineering and Context Engineering?",
    "expected_answer": "For traditional prompt engineering, the complexity involves a manual or automated search over a simple string space, where the target is maximizing output probability given a static string prompt ($\\arg \\max_{prompt} P_{\\theta}(Y|prompt)$) [3]. Context Engineering, however, involves **system-level optimization** of $F^* = \\arg \\max_F E_{\\tau\\sim T} [Reward(P_{\\theta}(Y|C_F (\\tau)), Y^*_{\\tau})]$, where F represents a set of complex context functions like Assembly, Retrieval, and Selection [3]. (Source: 3.1 Definition of Context Engineering)",
    "claude_answer": "Traditional prompt engineering focuses on optimizing a simple string prompt to maximize the probability of the desired output: $\\arg \\max_{prompt} P_{\\theta}(Y|prompt)$. This is essentially a search over string space. In contrast, Context Engineering optimizes at the system level with $F^* = \\arg \\max_F E_{\\tau\\sim T} [Reward(P_{\\theta}(Y|C_F (\\tau)), Y^*_{\\tau})]$, where F represents a set of complex context functions including Assembly, Retrieval, and Selection operations. Context Engineering therefore operates on a more complex optimization space involving multiple interacting functions rather than just string manipulation."
